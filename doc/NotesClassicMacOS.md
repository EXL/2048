Classic Mac OS Notes
====================

## Mac OS 9 Notes

I choose for Mac OS 9.0.4 development [Metrowerks CodeWarrior IDE 5.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CodeWarrior) and [Metrowerks PowerPlant Constructor 2.5.5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerPlant) programs which are included to the [CodeWarrior Pro 8](https://macintoshgarden.org/apps/codewarrior-pro-8x) distribution CD. I used the [Apple ResEdit 2.1.3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ResEdit) program to create various application resources like forms, dialogs, and icons. The compilers provided with Metrowerks CodeWarrior package can compile [ะก](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)) and [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B) code for [PowerPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerPC) architecture. Standard Apple technologies such as [Macintosh Toolbox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_Toolbox), [QuickDraw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QuickDraw) can be used with Metrowerks CodeWarrior IDE alongside with C and C++ standard libraries and [Carbon API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_(API)).

The CodeWarrior Pro 8 can compile both executable files for classic Mac OS ([CFM/PEF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preferred_Executable_Format)) and for Mac OS X ([Mach-O](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mach-O)), but I preferred to use the native development tools ([Project Builder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Builder) and [Interface Builder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_Builder)) to build a Carbon application for Mac OS X.

### Task List

18. [x] Check on Intel-based Mac OS.
19. [x] Add ReadMe.md files to the "Supporting Files" group in projects.

## Mac OS 8 Notes

I choose for Mac OS 8.1 development [Metrowerks CodeWarrior IDE 3.2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CodeWarrior), [Metrowerks PowerPlant Constructor 2.4.5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerPlant), and [Apple ResEdit 2.1.3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ResEdit) programs which are included to the [CodeWarrior Pro 4](https://macintoshgarden.org/apps/codewarrior-pro-4) distribution CD. The compilers provided with this package can compile [ะก](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)) and [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B) code for [Motorola 68000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola_68000) and [PowerPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerPC) architectures. Standard Apple technologies such as [Macintosh Toolbox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_Toolbox), [QuickDraw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QuickDraw), and [QuickDraw GX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QuickDraw_GX) can be used with Metrowerks CodeWarrior IDE alongside with C and C++ standard libraries.

The CodeWarrior Pro 4 package includes object-oriented [Metrowerks PowerPlant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerPlant) application framework, which is similar to the Think Class Library (TCL) from the Symantec THINK C integrated development environment. I think a lot of good things in the Metrowerks CodeWarrior IDE come from the Symantec THINK C world.

The [Macintosh Programmer's Workshop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_Programmer%27s_Workshop) (MPW) is a software development environment for the Classic Mac OS operating system, written by Apple, which was later superseded by the Metrowerks CodeWarrior IDE. MPW provided a collection of compilers and tools inside command line "MPW Shell" environment which was similar to UNIX-shells in desing but with a "worksheet" interface, allowing the user to select and run arbitrary sections of a shell script or to redo commands with no retyping. Metrowerks added to the Apple MPW own compilers, various auxiliary scripts, and some utilities. A set of "CodeWarrior MPW" tools is included in the **CodeWarrior Pro 4** distribution and requires preliminary manual configuration describes in [2048-Carbon/2048-MCW/ReadMe.md](../2048-Carbon/2048-MCW/ReadMe.md) document.

## A/UX Notes

I choose for Apple A/UX 3.0 & System Software 7.0.1 development just [vi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi) (v3.9 2/9/83) text editor by Bill Joy and built-in `cc` C language compiler by Apple which is based on Motorola SGS (Software Generation System) suite. Then I wrote a simple Makefile for building applications by looking at the source code of the examples that are located in "/mac/src/" directory. Unfortunately the C compiler supplied with A/UX is too old and doesn't even support C89 standard, only K&R C. So I had to change the code for old style and K&R C prestandard. Standard Apple technologies such as [Macintosh Toolbox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_Toolbox) and [QuickDraw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QuickDraw) can be used in A/UX system.

A/UX comes with four types of sessions:

* X11 (pure X11 session with `xterm` terminal emulator and `twm` window manager)
* A/UX Finder (32-bit) (native environment, just classic Mac OS System Software 7.0.1 with UNIX integration)
* A/UX Finder (24-bit) (left for compatibility and allows you to run non 32-bit applications)
* Console Emulator (like framebuffer console in Linux)

You can switch between them on the login window: "Special" => "Logout", then "Options" => "Change Session Type..." menu. The default password of `root` superuser is empty string.

To run X11 applications in the A/UX Finder (32-bit) environment A/UX proposed to use the MacX application which is located in "/mac/MacX/" directory. This application works in a similar way to modern technologies such as [XWayland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.Org_Server#XWayland) and [XQuartz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XQuartz) programs.

There are some auxiliary utilities to facilitate interaction between A/UX UNIX environment and classic Mac OS environment:

* `fcnvt -f -d mac_file unix_file` and `fcnvt -f -s unix_file mac_file` command converts the AppleSingle file (classic Mac OS) to AppleDouble format (A/UX UNIX-like) and split file attributes from data into a separate files started with "%" sign.
* `rez` and `derez` resource compiler and decompiler.
* `setfile` utility allows you to set the type and creator sign attributes to files.

For more details see [2048-AUX/Makefile](../2048-Carbon/2048-AUX/Makefile) build file.

### Task List

1. [x] Port and run X11 version, 2048-Xlib application.
2. [x] Port and run Toolbox version, 2048-AUX application.
3. [x] Add compiler info and version to document.
4. [x] Create "old" directory for ported engine to K&R prestandard C language.
5. [x] Note about 256 MB RAM on Shoebill command.
6. [x] Compile and test Macintosh Toolbox for A/UX code sample.
7. [x] Add links to ReadMe.md files.
8. [x] #ifdef AUX #endif AUX (don't need that).
9. [x] Check code style on K&R function declarations.
10. [x] Add some information about `DeRez` utility.
11. [x] Add some information about `fcnvt` utility.
12. [x] Port and run X11 version, 2048-Xaw application.
13. [x] Add short offscreen drawing function.
14. [x] Implement general drawing.
15. [x] Enable offscreen drawing by default and fix bugs.
16. [x] Fix bug with colors in offscreen.
17. [x] Drop background/foreground routines in other versions.
18. [x] Fix UNIX file rights.
19. [x] Add some note about setting file associations by ResEdit program.

## Mac OS System 6 Notes

I took for development under classic [Mac OS System 6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_6) the [Symantec THINK C 5.0.2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/THINK_C) IDE and [Apple ResEdit 2.1.1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ResEdit) program which is already included to the THINK C distribution kit. THINK C expands a traditional [C language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)) syntax with basic [object-oriented programming (OOP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) concepts such as single inheritance, object and classes, these extensions make programming more familar and convenient. Standard Apple technologies such as [Macintosh Toolbox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_Toolbox) and [QuickDraw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QuickDraw) can be used with THINK C alongside with [ANSI C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_C) language standard library.

The THINK C offered the programmer a powerful object-oriented Think Class Library (TCL) framework, which was used extensively for Macintosh application development.

### Task List

1. [x] Check `NumberToStr()` function and `Str15` type for small Pascal strings.
2. [x] Check `THINK_C` compiler macro define on Symantec THINK C 5.0.2 IDE.
