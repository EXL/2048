Disk Images
===========

Due to the [resource fork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_fork) complexity in the file systems of the classic Mac OS it is impossible to distribute programs and files without losing some attributes and important data in some cases e.g. CFM/PEF executables for [Motorola 68000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola_68000) architecture which store the machine code in a resource forks.

In a computer file system, a [fork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(file_system)) is a set of data associated with a file-system object. File systems without forks only allow a single set of data for the contents, while file systems with forks allow multiple such contents.

To prevent the loss of important data, the necessary project files are distributed as a disk images that can be mounted in various emulators.
